-- Block Chain tutorial
A blockchain is just a chain/list of blocks. Each block in the blockchain will have its own
digital signature, contain digital signature of the previous block, and have some data
(could be transaction for example)
Block 1: {digital signature = 123, Data = "Hello Minh", Previous Hash = 0}
Block 2: {digital signature = 234, Data = "Hello Ngan", Previous Hash = 123}
p/s: Hash = Digital Signature

-- Calculating and comparing the hashes allow us to see if a blockchain is invalid.
=> CHanging any data in this list, will change the signature and break the chain.
